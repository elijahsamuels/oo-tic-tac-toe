Remember that, from the player's point of view, the board contains spaces 1-9. But the indices in an array start their count at 0. If the user inputs 5, your method must correctly translate that from the player's perspective to the array's perspective â€” accounting for the fact that @board[5] is not where the user intended to place their token.

    # The #position_taken? method will be responsible for evaluating the user's desired move against the Tic Tac Toe board and checking to see whether or not that position is already occupied. Note that this method will be running after #input_to_index, so it will be checking index values. When it is passed the index value for a prospective move, #position_taken? will check to see if that position on the @board is vacant or if it contains an "X" or an "O". If the position is free, the method should return false (i.e., "the position is not taken"); otherwise, it will return true.
